# osu! Server Manager

# How it works
* It uses new cutting-edge feature to switch server (-devserver <endpoint>)

# Features
* Simple Console UI
* Server selector
* Server adder (Adding servers directly from this app)
* Saves your credentials automatically, so osu! won't flush them (The main reason i coded it.)
